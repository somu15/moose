## Improved INL HPC Remote Connectivity

The [hpc_remote.md] instructions have been updated for a better user experience in accessing web-based INL HPC resources. The previous instructions involved using an additional browser with a proxy to access said resources (hpcgitlab, moosebuild, hpcweb, etc). The new proxy configuration file method is much easier to setup for the end-user and does not require an additional browser. For more information, see [hpc_remote.md#socks-proxy].

## Ray Tracing Module

Native ray tracing capability has been released in the [ray_tracing/index.md].

The module traces rays throughout the finite element mesh. Notable features include:

- Ray contribution to residuals and Jacobians along ray segments (example: line sources)
- Tracing on meshes with adaptivity
- Supports ray interaction with internal and external boundaries
- Supports storage and manipulation of data unique to each ray
- Supports ray interaction with field variables
- Supports parallel execution

## SQA Failure Analysis Report

Failure analysis reports were added to the SQA documentation, see [framework_far.md] for an example.

## SQA Extension Documentation

Documentation for setting up MOOSE-based applications to leverage capabilities of MooseDocs
for SQA was added: [extensions/sqa.md].
