/**
 * This is a helper class for managing the storage of declared Reporter object values. This design
 * of the system is a generalization of the VectorPostprocessor system that the Reporter objects
 * replaced.
 *
 * Foremost, this object doesn't store the data. It simply acts as helper for using the restart
 * system of the MooseApp. This object automatically handles the old, older, ... data. All
 * declarations create std::pair<T, std::vector<T>> restartable data on the MooseApp, where the
 * first value is the current value and the data in the vector are the older data.
 *
 * The ReporterState object is a RestartableData object that serves as a helper for managing the
 * time history. A "context" object also exists that uses the ReporterState for preforming special
 * operations. Refer to ReporterState.h/C for more information.
 *
 * It is important to note that the Reporter values are not threaded. However, the Reporter
 * objects are UserObject based, so the calculation of the values can be threaded.
 *
 * This object also relies on ReporterName objects, which are simply a combination of the
 * Reporter object name and the data name. If you recall the VectorPostprocessor system on which
 * this is based required an object name and a vector name. The ReporterName class simply provides
 * a convenient way to provide that information in a single object. Special Parser syntax
 * was also defined so that application developers do not have to have input parameters for
 * both the object and data names (see Parser.C/h).
